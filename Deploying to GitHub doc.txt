- Open your project folder.

- Create a virtual enviroment

* Virtual environment isolates our prject. Anything we install within the virtual environment does not effect the rest 

of the computer and vice-versa.

* on cmd: vitualenv . (to install virtual environment)

* Activate the virtual environment by running activate.bat files within scripts folder.

- git status git commands 

* git init

This creates .git folder on our project folder that means git is initialized.

* git status

This shows all te folders that are not added to git.

* git add -all

This adds all the files to git.

* git commit -m "commit message"

This commits all folders to git.

* git log

This shows the log of all commits in our repository. This displays most recent commits first.

- Now we need to push our existing repository. First we will need to add push our remote origin which is our remote
repository that we created on GitHub. Copy the HTTPs web url and paste in cmd.

* git remote add origin weburl

- Now, we will need to push our local repository to our remote repository or GitHub account we use.

* git push -u origin master

- In case we get error 'failed to push some reps to weburl, run below commands

* git pull --rebase origin master

* git push origin master

- Now we can see our project on our GitHub repository.
